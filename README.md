# Huffman Coding User Interface

This project implements a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Java-based desktop application that applies the Huffman Coding algorithm for data compression.

## Overview

Huffman coding is a **lossless data compression algorithm** used to reduce the size of data without any loss of information. The algorithm assigns variable-length codes to input characters, where the lengths of the codes are based on the frequencies of the corresponding characters. The most frequent character receives the shortest code, and the least frequent character gets the longest code. The resulting codes are **prefix codes**, which ensures that no code is a prefix of another. This property guarantees that there is no ambiguity during the decoding process.

## Project Description

This project is a **JavaFX** application developed as part of an assignment for an **Algorithms** course. The graphical user interface (GUI) allows users to interact with the program easily, providing a simple and intuitive way to compress files using Huffman coding.

### Key Features:
- **File Compression**: The application supports compressing files of various formats.
- **User-friendly Interface**: The JavaFX-based GUI enables easy interaction with the program.
- **Efficient Compression**: The algorithm ensures high compression efficiency with minimal loss of data.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- **JavaFX Library**: This project requires the JavaFX library to be included in the classpath in order to build and run the application.

## Installation and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that **JavaFX** is properly configured in your development environment.
3. Compile and run the application using your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).
4. The graphical interface will prompt you to select a file for compression. The program will then apply the Huffman coding algorithm and display the compressed result.

## File Format Support

The application is designed to compress any file type. Users can select any file to compress, regardless of its format. The program will handle the input accordingly and generate a compressed output.

## How It Works

1. The user selects a file to compress.
2. The program calculates the frequency of each character in the file.
3. Using the frequencies, the program builds the Huffman tree.
4. The Huffman codes are generated, and the file is compressed.
5. The compressed file is saved, and the user can view the output.
